# JavaScript Logic Lab

A set of JavaScript micro projects exploring UI interactions,
DOM manipulation, and frontend logic.

This repository contains small projects created during the
learning process of coding, with a strong focus on logic and
clear understanding rather than complexity.

Each project targets specific concepts such as user input
handling, event-driven behavior, DOM updates, and basic state
management using plain JavaScript.

## Focus Areas
- JavaScript fundamentals
- Logic building and problem solving
- DOM manipulation
- UI interactions and behavior
- Clean and readable code

## Structure
Each folder represents one micro project and includes its
own files and a short description.
